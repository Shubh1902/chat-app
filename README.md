### `npm i`
### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

Functionality for adding a comment, replying to any comment and deleting any comment. 

user name and images are generated randomly from jsonplaceholder api. 

I have tweaked ui a bit to make it look a bit more like comments.

Code for editing comments is written which I will complete as a personal project.

I have used localstorage to store the data to facilitate persistance on page reload.

Changing data in localstorage changes data in all tabs. 

Note: I am certainly aware of the user experience points which are missing here that I can implement.
